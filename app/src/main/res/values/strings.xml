  <string name="about_intro1">This app was created as a technical demonstration of speech output and voice recognition in playing of classic parser Interactive Fiction stories. Please note the opening activity menu options to enable speech output and recognition. TECHNICAL NOTE: Incant has a custom Java Glulx internal interpreter that can run many stories. However, it can be too slow for complex Interactive Fiction works such as Emily Short\'s Counterfeit Monkey story.</string>
  <string name="app_intro3">This app is entirely free software and the source code is available on GitHub. You are encouraged to further refine and utilize this app\'s Java source code for Android:</string>
  <string name="about_intro2">This app variation, \'Incant! for Thunderword\', was extended by Wake Reality to serve as a technical demonstration of a third-party story download and launcher app for Thunderword\'s internal Glulx and Z-Machine interpreter engines.</string>
  <string name="app_intro4">Special note about story data files, works of Interactive Fiction: No works are included with the download of this app. Incant!\'s opening menu is only a description and link to the stories off various public websites. Only once a story is picked from the menu is it downloaded live off the internet website. Incant! does not distribute the copyrighted story data files on it\'s own. You can long-press the menu entry to see a link to information about the story author.</string>
