""All Things Devours is a short piece of interactive fiction, leaning strongly towards the text-adventure end of the spectrum. It explores an all-too-familiar science fiction paradigm in what I hope is a rather refreshing and satisfying manner. However, due to the intrinsic nature of its subject matter, it is more cruel than one might hope for a modern piece of interactive fiction. In particular, any move you make may put things into an unwinnable state. You are therefore encouraged to save frequently, and also to realise that you will probably have to start over several times to find the most satisfactory ending."""

Be aware that this is a work of horror.

This game involves situations that may be violent, distressing, disturbing, or triggering. 

This game may involve positive interactions with a violent sociopath. The game may involve elements of coercion and powerlessness. The game is not sexually explicit but does involve some adult language and potentially dark imagery.

The tone this work will take about grim situations is fairly clinical. If any of these things sound like they will upset you, I would advise you not to play.

 It's been called ""part of the latest craze in home computing (TIME magazine), an ""amazing feat of programming"" (THE NEW YORK TIMES) and the ""Best Adventure of 1983"" (ELECTRONIC GAMES). 

It's Deadline, and it puts you, the keen-eyed sleuth, against a 12-hour time limit to solve a classic locked-door mystery. Armed only with the clues inside this package and your own wits, you must sift through myriads of evidence and motives to track down the killer. No easy feat, for all six of your suspects exercise free will - coming and going, scheming and maneuvering independently of your actions. And some of these personalities are so treacherous that, should you make the wrong move, one of them may do you in. 

Difficulty: Expert.

One of the sixth-graders didn't go to outdoor ed, and therefore spent the week in my fifth-grade classroom, playing Scott Adams's <i>Impossible Mission</i> on a TRS-80 while the rest of us did our schoolwork. At recess we crowded around him and shouted out commands to try. I really wanted a turn at the keyboard, but this guy wouldn't let anyone else near it. It would be another couple of years before I played a text adventure myself.

My big chance came when my father signed up for the Dow Jones online service, which offered not just stock listings but sports scores, movie reviews, <i>Grolier's Encyclopedia</i>, and a small selection of games, among which was <i>Adventure</i>. A bargain at a mere $144/hour! (In 1984 dollars!) Fortunately for my father's bank account, I eventually learned about Orange County's free BBSes, most of which were WWIV boards written in Pascal. Borland's Turbo Pascal let you swap in external modules called ""door games,"" some of which were text adventures, and I've had the code to a few of these kicking around for (ulp!) a quarter of a century now. For a long time I've thought that it might be kind of fun to port one over to Inform, and I finally found the time to do so. Warning! These things were not exactly up to Infocom standards, let alone those of the modern day. This is a nostalgia project. Swords, trolls, magic spells, hit points. But no acoustic coupler necessary!"

A conversation with a work of art. ""47. Galatea. White Thasos marble. Non-commissioned work by the late Pygmalion of Cyprus. (The artist has since committed suicide.) Originally not an animate. The waking of this piece from its natural state remains unexplained.""

Galatea is my first released foray into interactive fiction. It is a single conversation with a single character, which can end any of a number of ways depending on the player's decisions. Despite its age, I continue to get strong reactions to it in my email inbox on a fairly regular basis. Some people love it; some people find it annoying or distressing.

Galatea has what I call a multilinear plot: unlike traditional IF, it has no single path to victory. Instead there are a large number of endings, some more satisfactory than others, of which many could be considered ""win"" states. It takes only a few minutes of play to arrive at an ending, but considerably longer to find all of them.

The game also takes an ambitious approach to NPC (non-player character) conversation, both in terms of volume (Galatea has many hundreds of things to say) and complexity (she keeps track of the state of conversation and reacts differently according to what has already been said and done)."

<B>*GAUCHO*</B>

The tour had been going exceedingly well up to this point. You've always yearned to visit a Ghost Town and your affection for the Old West has never been stronger. It stemmed from your early years of playing Cowboys and Indians with the neighborhood gang. When the opportunity came up, this was a no-miss trip! A remote town on the old Texas-Mexico border that has been left untouched and well-preserved in the arid climate for more than a century. This is exactly the vacation that you have craved! At one time, this place was a bustling little frontier town of notable repute. Nameless now, the town was once filled with frontiersmen. ""Gauchos"" the underpaid South American tour guide kept calling them. Cowboys by any other name. It doesn't matter what nationality a cowboy is, he remains an icon and a legend. You couldn't wait to get here - when you logged out of the Geek and set your Facebook status to 'On Vacation', you were going totally tech-free, just like the pioneers did. Even more special is that this particular no-name town was founded by none other than General Jebbidiah Alden in 1865. A Civil War hero who made it his mission in life to help rebuild after the destruction caused by the war. General Alden was well-liked and well-respected. History remembers him kindly. His descendants still live only a few hundred miles from the site of this now long-abandoned ghost town. Unfortunately, your allergies have kicked in at the worst possible time. Before long the tour guide was speaking but all you could concentrate on was the stuffiness in your head. Breathing became a labor and staying alert a chore. If you could just rest your head for a few minutes... It wasn't exactly clear when you fell asleep, but the tour guide and your fellow tourists have moved on without you. The last thing you can remember is the tour guide saying that the group could take a short break for lunch, take a last look around and then get back on the bus for the trip home. As you wake up, you can hear the clunker of a bus pull out of the parking lot to the north. 

Welcome to Gaucho! Your goal is to survive one (1) night here in this ghost town so you can be picked up by the next tour bus that will arrive in the morning. With your allergies acting up, you'll need a good night's sleep to make it through. And you are so thirsty that you'll never be able to sleep without a good long chug of water. To survive in this old frontier town, you will need all of your wits to combat puzzles and obstacles that stand in your way. As you progress, you will uncover various special items and, quite possibly, some gold. At the end of your adventure (if you either Win or Quit), you will be given a unique code that you can use on the Geek to claim special microbadges and geekgold. At any time during the game, you can type SCORE to see your progress. If you wish to give up and simply claim your earned prizes, you can type QUIT. If you win the game, it will be obvious as to how to claim your prizes. The maximum score for this game is 100. If you need a bit of generic help, type HELP. Good luck!"

<B>*GEIST*</B>

You were celebrating the arrival of the not-quite-second-half of the 21st century with your buddies in your gaming basement when the bad news arrived: Crazy Uncle Scott had finally given up the good fight and passed off into gaming nirvana. He was an unusual man, with a firm belief that the world went to hell in a hand-basket with the arrival of text messages, always claiming that their phones were smarter than them! So he bought himself a huge mansion and spent his last days there pining for the glory days of yore, when websites were nothing more than acres of bright blue links thrown willy-nilly onto a computer screen.

Somehow, though, he took a shine to you, and you were smart enough to hide your smartphone whenever he came calling. Nevertheless, it was quite a surprise to learn that he left you exactly half his will. And even more of a surprise to discover that the lawyer's language was precise: not half his massive fortune in Geekgold, but literally half his will. Along with a short note explaining that to collect your full inheritance, you must retrieve the second half of Crazy Uncle Scott's will from his old estate, Alden Manor. The very name brings chills to your spine: that place is haunted!

But the true horror lay in the closing passage of the note:

<B>Leave your Smartphone at home!</B>"

It also warns about possibly locking up your entire computer. This is highly unlikely in modern OSes. The warning stands - but your OS will most probably be safe. I asked around about it and got this helpful answer from Zarf:

""I believe the specific issue is if the game tries to write to a memory address outside the Z-machine's allocated range. (Most Inform games manage to avoid this, but Inform School allows the player to set up some crazy code constructions. This is what the author is warning you about.)

A good interpreter will check all game memory accesses, and throw a fatal error if anything is out of bounds. Early interpreters didn't always do this, because of the CPU cost of these constant checks. At this point all interpreters should do it. Even on mobile devices, which are (at this point) as powerful as 1999-era desktop machines, anyhow."""

And now something is wrong. You have seen the Enchanters and Sorcerers discussing it in hushed tones. Magic is failing. And there are rumors that GUE Tech will be closed. That would end your dreams of magic forever.

There is only one solution, although it is looking less feasible by the minute. Take your spell book, break into the library, and steal some magic from the Guild of Enchanters.

This is a one-room game where you play a character ready to kill herself. The challenge is in deciding on a method that actually works. There are 29 different endings to the game, some involving unsuccessful deaths, some involving successful deaths, as well as some involving alternatives to death. 

The game involves elements of dark humor, and is not difficult. Drug use is possible, and adult scenarios is kind of a give in (considering it's related to suicide), but it isn't tastless. The intention is to show the consequences of failed suicide attempts, as well as the family consequences of successful suicide. 

Given that there are so many endings, the game is never ""unwinnable"" (especially since death is a goal), however you may render a given ending unreachable by your actions. The game is very short and not overly difficult."

Every citizen is required to have a chip implant which can definitively identify them to anyone with a scanner. You've spent years working with the underground as a hacker for hire, helping research and develop countermeasures to government surveillance. You've managed to steal information which will help the design of a cryptographic attack against the Mitsui-Klein Encapsulation that every citizen carries in their skull, which (if it works) will render the chip inoperative. Your own MitKlein signature was captured during your mission, however. Although you did your best to wipe all records of your MitKlein signature from all the databases you could find, if you let your chip be scanned by any system it is likely that Homeland Security will be after you immediately. Short term, you'll have to get off the street before curfew and figure out how to move around undetected - long term, you will have to bring the fight to Homeland Security itself.

We start the game as Farahnaaz, a bookcrafter and a library employee in Arg Varkana, currently enjoying her summer holidays when the town is lively with celebrations. Her hometown is to be visited by a team of ambassadors from Ashtarta, a distant, fabled land with a more advanced technology and a recently-reestablished regime.

All starts peacefully, but a neglection to do a simple task she was given eventually turns Farahnaaz's calm day into a troublesome one - to another one's luck and fortune."
