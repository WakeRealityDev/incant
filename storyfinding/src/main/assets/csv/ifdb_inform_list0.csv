""All Things Devours is a short piece of interactive fiction, leaning strongly towards the text-adventure end of the spectrum. It explores an all-too-familiar science fiction paradigm in what I hope is a rather refreshing and satisfying manner. However, due to the intrinsic nature of its subject matter, it is more cruel than one might hope for a modern piece of interactive fiction. In particular, any move you make may put things into an unwinnable state. You are therefore encouraged to save frequently, and also to realise that you will probably have to start over several times to find the most satisfactory ending.""","NULL","NULL","NULL","Time Travel","Cruel","2400","http://www.amirrorclear.net/flowers/game/devours/","NULL","2007-09-29 00:00:00","vw7fr8dlv3k7i3pm","2013-11-04 22:10:02","7"

This game was designed by a group of graduate students and their professor at Utah State University as an activity to test activity-goal alignment for researching educational game design. The game was implemented in a class of middle-school students on their unit of poetry covering early 20th century American literature: ""Spoon River Anthology"" by Edgar Lee Masters.

Note there are 2 Easter eggs found within the game as well. One has to do with the common items collected in IF that *seem* to have no function here. When this egg is unlocked the entire Spoon River Anthology is available for reading within the game. The second Easter egg has to do with the single item that has no useful purpose in solving the ghosts' issues, and will reveal epitaphs of the authors when ""used"" properly.

Unfortunately this isn't the Naked City. This is Pleasantville, USA, population 50,000. And you're not exactly working for the network news.

One Tuesday, they just didn't come home, and there's been no sign of them since.  For the University and the rest of the town, the mystery is beginning to pall.  To those people, it's as if Claire and Scott Colborn suddenly stopped existing -- strange and inexplicable, to be sure, but forgettable in the long run.

But for you it's as if the ground beneath your feet stopped existing, and you've been plummeting in freefall ever since.  Your brother Austin, though, has been a rock through the whole experience, handling the numbing details, the endless meetings with useless detectives, even sorting through Mom and Dad's lab in hopes of finding an answer.  Now you stand outside the lab door, clutching his note, hardly daring to hope that such an answer may have arrived at long last.

This will happen. It also warns about possibly locking up your entire computer. This is highly unlikely in modern OSes. The warning stands - but your OS will most probably be safe. I asked around about it and got this helpful answer from Zarf:

""I believe the specific issue is if the game tries to write to a memory address outside the Z-machine's allocated range. (Most Inform games manage to avoid this, but Inform School allows the player to set up some crazy code constructions. This is what the author is warning you about.)

A good interpreter will check all game memory accesses, and throw a fatal error if anything is out of bounds. Early interpreters didn't always do this, because of the CPU cost of these constant checks. At this point all interpreters should do it. Even on mobile devices, which are (at this point) as powerful as 1999-era desktop machines, anyhow.""","NULL","NULL","NULL","Educational","NULL","458","NULL","NULL","2007-09-29 00:00:00","gy4p10myt2srnjyp","2013-02-25 15:22:31","4"

One false move, and the killer strikes again. 
 It's been called ""part of the latest craze in home computing (TIME magazine), an ""amazing feat of programming"" (THE NEW YORK TIMES) and the ""Best Adventure of 1983"" (ELECTRONIC GAMES). 

It's Deadline, and it puts you, the keen-eyed sleuth, against a 12-hour time limit to solve a classic locked-door mystery. Armed only with the clues inside this package and your own wits, you must sift through myriads of evidence and motives to track down the killer. No easy feat, for all six of your suspects exercise free will - coming and going, scheming and maneuvering independently of your actions. And some of these personalities are so treacherous that, should you make the wrong move, one of them may do you in. 

Difficulty: Expert.

A conversation with a work of art. ""47. Galatea. White Thasos marble. Non-commissioned work by the late Pygmalion of Cyprus. (The artist has since committed suicide.) Originally not an animate. The waking of this piece from its natural state remains unexplained.""

Galatea is my first released foray into interactive fiction. It is a single conversation with a single character, which can end any of a number of ways depending on the player's decisions. Despite its age, I continue to get strong reactions to it in my email inbox on a fairly regular basis. Some people love it; some people find it annoying or distressing.

Galatea has what I call a multilinear plot: unlike traditional IF, it has no single path to victory. Instead there are a large number of endings, some more satisfactory than others, of which many could be considered ""win"" states. It takes only a few minutes of play to arrive at an ending, but considerably longer to find all of them.

The game also takes an ambitious approach to NPC (non-player character) conversation, both in terms of volume (Galatea has many hundreds of things to say) and complexity (she keeps track of the state of conversation and reacts differently according to what has already been said and done).","http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?coverart&id=urxrv27t7qtu52lb","NULL","NULL","Mythological","Merciful","1326","http://emshort.wordpress.com/my-work/","NULL","2007-09-29 00:00:00","4onqcn9pq2wtd3vb","2015-05-01 05:37:35","15"

This is a very early adventure game. The young authors (aged 10-14 at the time) started writing the game in the computer center of a university in 1977, and it should come as no surprise that they were heavily inspired by <a game=""fft6pu91j85y4acv"">Adventure</a>.

We start the game as Farahnaaz, a bookcrafter and a library employee in Arg Varkana, currently enjoying her summer holidays when the town is lively with celebrations. Her hometown is to be visited by a team of ambassadors from Ashtarta, a distant, fabled land with a more advanced technology and a recently-reestablished regime.

Lucius Winterson, the Eurmerican ambassador delegated to greet the aliens, was so successful in his mission that he eventually became Earth's sole representative on the Zal'tac Council. In return, he acquired personal technology that has kept him alive throughout the millennia, creating an Empire in the process, the Xulthe'en Empire.

In Across The Stars, you serve the Xulthe'en Empire aboard a deep-space transport. Adjusting to your lifestyle hasn't been easy though, your berth is small and cramped and the twelve-and-a-half-hour shifts are long. The Captain even gave you an extra week of duty for not having your uniform property squared away. In a place this small, you're beginning to wonder if you have what it takes to serve the Empire.

THE PLOT: In a bistro in Paris a young woman (A) tells her three girlfriends (B, C, and D) about the affair she had with an American tourist, who returned home promising to write, and hasn't. It's been over two weeks; something must have happened to him. (She has just learned she is carrying his child, but she doesn't tell her friends.) B tells her to call him; C to e-mail him; D to forget all about him. Enter a fat American couple; each of them has a different speech impediment. They order food. The man chokes. A performs the Heimlich maneuver on him, and saves his life.

Dear friend. My sojourn in parts foreign is at an ende. I am at lodgings in Southwark not far from the bridge at Stoney Street, come dine with me two days hence to ring in the newe year. I have not enjoyed amiable English companie for some long time and it would be refreshing to hear my mother tongue used in its proper manner again.

John Croft.</i>

When you receive this note from your old acquantence John Croft, you expect nothing but an evening of good food and drink and Croft's lecherous tales. Instead, you quickly find yourself plunged into a conspiracy of black magic that involves not only Croft but some of the most powerful and important men in London -- and possibly even someone else, someone much closer to your own heart.

The King of Shreds and Patches is a novel-length work of interactive fiction. In it you will explore an historically accurate recreation of Elizabethan London, circa 1603, interact with some fascinating characters both historical and fictional, and (if you are clever and lucky) thwart an occult conspiracy that threatens to bring down the entire city -- or worse.

Recently promoted to the post of junior marketing executive at the Funhouse Novelty Company, you're the one who comes up with all those zany items you can buy for a Dollar in the pages of Cosmic Comics.

But something is missing in your life. A nagging question gnaws at your soul, undermines your joy at your new-found success and interferes with the very business of living. But this is not a answer you can find in the pages of any book; for what you yearn to know is the very meaning of life itself!

But then you learned about a man, a guru of great wisdom, endowed with the miraculous supreme realisation who could teach you the secrets of the universe. A six hundred year old hermit living at the top of a mountain in a kingdom most right-thinking people assume to be a myth. A man known as the Dada Lama!

And this is why we find you now, after many months of journeying, of fruitless searching, beaten and battered by the uncaring elements, in this mysterious valley hidden deep within the mountains...

...the mystical valley of Shangri-La!

NOTE
This game is told in a series of scenes, just like a radio drama. Each scene is independent from the one before in the sense that it is impossible to put the game in an unwinnable state by not having done something in an earlier scene.
There are several ways to lose this game and there are a few timed puzzles. Saving when advised should avoid undue frustration. UNDO is always an option. Feel free to use it liberally. 
Small parts of this game deliberately rank ""Nasty"" on the Zarfian scale but this is only true within each self-contained scene, not for the game at large, and a full in-game HELP system is available should you get stuck.","http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?coverart&id=9afd8nocghwc3trw","NULL","NULL","Mystery","Nasty","NULL","http://housefullofgames.com/SamFortune/","NULL","2009-05-17 12:25:30","ublbibz02an5cgnr","2009-06-01 16:06:41","3"

You will explore the cottage and its surroundings. The computer is your eyes and hands. Inside the cottage anything can happen; you can fall down trapdoors, robbers can take all your valuables, escalators can be roped off and telephones can ring. Outside the house there are large forests to rove, waterfalls to shower in and mysterious creatures that appear when you least expect it...

In searching for clues she discovers a spellbook and must learn various magical spells and go to several different lands to find out what happened to her husband and baby and to go to retrieve them. 

This is the author's first work. The work includes some throwback to games such as Zork and Enchanter, including a similar spell system to enchanter, and the game taking place in a small white house, though all the puzzles are unique to the game, the game makes several references to other interactive fiction games. The game is intended to be humerous. 

The game is in Glulxe format. The forgivness rating is cruel- it is possible to make the game unwinnable without realizing it until later. There is at least one event which can be potentially missed which is required to complete the game. 

The game should be considered of moderate to long length- compare it to the length of Zork I rather than Suveh Nux or other competition games. The writing style is conversational, and it contains an ""outfit"" system, where NPCs react to you based on the clothes you wear, and a spellcasting system.

This is my first ever interactive fiction. I just started learning Inform 7 and I am planning to create a series of interactive fictions with it. This game is the very short prologue to the series, and is not very impressive. I hope to learn to utilize many more features in the future and make more complicated games.","http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?coverart&id=8i7hq6gdo677mzm1","The Saturn Chronicles","0","Science Fiction","Merciful","NULL","NULL","NULL","2010-03-26 18:58:56","yb2dpwyde1i0t6uj","2010-03-26 18:58:56","1"

I created it as an entry for the Ludum Dare 48 Hour Game Competition #17. 

The game is about a programmer who is trying to create a game in the Ludum Dare 48 Hour Game Competition, but is constantly getting distracted by various things. The game has dark humor, strong language and lots of toilet humor. I think it should appeal to programmers and techies. 

I would not recommend the game for children because of the nature of some of the puzzles. The game is short and I consider it very easy. I don't think it would take anyone familiar with interactive fiction more than 15-30 minutes to finish the game.

I'm very satisfied with the work considering that I only had 48 hours to create the game and more importantly I had never used inform 7 before. The stuff I was doing with the language by the end of the 48 hours was 100 times better than the stuff I was doing at the beginning. I really wish the inform IDE had a spell checker though. I think the big problem with the game after reviewing what I had accomplished was that the parser is weak. I didn't have time to try to figure out all the responses players would come with, so I imagine the frustration level of the game might be high, even though the game is super simple.

Finally, I do think the ending is particularly inspired and I would like to hear any feedback you might have on it. If anyone cares or likes the game, I may do some cleanup and improvements on all the problems and things I left unfinished.

One of the sixth-graders didn't go to outdoor ed, and therefore spent the week in my fifth-grade classroom, playing Scott Adams's <i>Impossible Mission</i> on a TRS-80 while the rest of us did our schoolwork. At recess we crowded around him and shouted out commands to try. I really wanted a turn at the keyboard, but this guy wouldn't let anyone else near it. It would be another couple of years before I played a text adventure myself.

My big chance came when my father signed up for the Dow Jones online service, which offered not just stock listings but sports scores, movie reviews, <i>Grolier's Encyclopedia</i>, and a small selection of games, among which was <i>Adventure</i>. A bargain at a mere $144/hour! (In 1984 dollars!) Fortunately for my father's bank account, I eventually learned about Orange County's free BBSes, most of which were WWIV boards written in Pascal. Borland's Turbo Pascal let you swap in external modules called ""door games,"" some of which were text adventures, and I've had the code to a few of these kicking around for (ulp!) a quarter of a century now. For a long time I've thought that it might be kind of fun to port one over to Inform, and I finally found the time to do so. Warning! These things were not exactly up to Infocom standards, let alone those of the modern day. This is a nostalgia project. Swords, trolls, magic spells, hit points. But no acoustic coupler necessary!

Be aware that this is a work of horror.

This game involves situations that may be violent, distressing, disturbing, or triggering. 

This game may involve positive interactions with a violent sociopath. The game may involve elements of coercion and powerlessness. The game is not sexually explicit but does involve some adult language and potentially dark imagery.

The tone this work will take about grim situations is fairly clinical. If any of these things sound like they will upset you, I would advise you not to play.

You've managed to steal information which will help the design of a cryptographic attack against the Mitsui-Klein Encapsulation that every citizen carries in their skull, which (if it works) will render the chip inoperative.

The severe cramp in your neck seems almost inconsequential in comparison with the pounding in your head.  Your suspicions are roused as to what may have happened the previous night because, as yet, you can remember nothing.  A peculiarly furry sensation in your mouth, combined with the unmistakable stench of very cheap scotch, adds to your mounting fear.

By the time your vision clears and you notice that you are lying in the bath of your friend's hall of residence, it is clear to you that you are a victim of Jessica's 21st Birthday Party, as advertised on lamp posts and fences across the city for the past three months.

Your liver is reporting major difficulties and your stomach produces intermittent gurgles of protest.  Your head drowns out all other considerations, however, and you sit up, take a look around you, and pray for death...

Humanity has been decimated by The Event, an astronomical apocalypse that has sent the last remnants of the human race scurrying to hide in Mechanosatellites, where they think they are safe from the continuing destruction outside the metal hulls of the spaceborne arks.

While they do seem to be safe, for the moment, from the reshaping of the Andromeda Galaxy happening around them, humanity is not safe from what has always been its greatest enemy; itself.

The Mechanosatellites are ruled by the despotic leaders of the Military, who enforce their rule over the civilians with varying degrees of control and compassion.  Sure, they make sure the lifts run on time and that there is nutrimash in the cafeteria - but if you're a thorn in their side they will crush you.

You are Quin, a civilian on Mechanosatellite 3, colloquially known as Trips, and you are bristling under the thumb of the Mil.  But what can be done, when the merest protest can lead to a long spacewalk without a spacesuit?  You've almost resigned yourself to a life of servitude.

That is, of course, until you hear about a mysterious message... a message that just might break the iron grip of the Mil.","http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?coverart&id=fspg9feojrfbh9rn","the Andromeda Series","5","Science Fiction","Polite","NULL","NULL","NULL","2013-07-16 21:43:11","pnol3f188wivwc6q","2015-08-08 08:16:05","8"

The tour had been going exceedingly well up to this point. You've always yearned to visit a Ghost Town and your affection for the Old West has never been stronger. It stemmed from your early years of playing Cowboys and Indians with the neighborhood gang. When the opportunity came up, this was a no-miss trip! A remote town on the old Texas-Mexico border that has been left untouched and well-preserved in the arid climate for more than a century. This is exactly the vacation that you have craved! At one time, this place was a bustling little frontier town of notable repute. Nameless now, the town was once filled with frontiersmen. ""Gauchos"" the underpaid South American tour guide kept calling them. Cowboys by any other name. It doesn't matter what nationality a cowboy is, he remains an icon and a legend. You couldn't wait to get here - when you logged out of the Geek and set your Facebook status to 'On Vacation', you were going totally tech-free, just like the pioneers did. Even more special is that this particular no-name town was founded by none other than General Jebbidiah Alden in 1865. A Civil War hero who made it his mission in life to help rebuild after the destruction caused by the war. General Alden was well-liked and well-respected. History remembers him kindly. His descendants still live only a few hundred miles from the site of this now long-abandoned ghost town. Unfortunately, your allergies have kicked in at the worst possible time. Before long the tour guide was speaking but all you could concentrate on was the stuffiness in your head. Breathing became a labor and staying alert a chore. If you could just rest your head for a few minutes... It wasn't exactly clear when you fell asleep, but the tour guide and your fellow tourists have moved on without you. The last thing you can remember is the tour guide saying that the group could take a short break for lunch, take a last look around and then get back on the bus for the trip home. As you wake up, you can hear the clunker of a bus pull out of the parking lot to the north. 

Welcome to Gaucho! Your goal is to survive one (1) night here in this ghost town so you can be picked up by the next tour bus that will arrive in the morning. With your allergies acting up, you'll need a good night's sleep to make it through. And you are so thirsty that you'll never be able to sleep without a good long chug of water. To survive in this old frontier town, you will need all of your wits to combat puzzles and obstacles that stand in your way. As you progress, you will uncover various special items and, quite possibly, some gold. At the end of your adventure (if you either Win or Quit), you will be given a unique code that you can use on the Geek to claim special microbadges and geekgold. At any time during the game, you can type SCORE to see your progress. If you wish to give up and simply claim your earned prizes, you can type QUIT. If you win the game, it will be obvious as to how to claim your prizes. The maximum score for this game is 100. If you need a bit of generic help, type HELP. Good luck!

You were celebrating the arrival of the not-quite-second-half of the 21st century with your buddies in your gaming basement when the bad news arrived: Crazy Uncle Scott had finally given up the good fight and passed off into gaming nirvana. He was an unusual man, with a firm belief that the world went to hell in a hand-basket with the arrival of text messages, always claiming that their phones were smarter than them! So he bought himself a huge mansion and spent his last days there pining for the glory days of yore, when websites were nothing more than acres of bright blue links thrown willy-nilly onto a computer screen.

Somehow, though, he took a shine to you, and you were smart enough to hide your smartphone whenever he came calling. Nevertheless, it was quite a surprise to learn that he left you exactly half his will. And even more of a surprise to discover that the lawyer's language was precise: not half his massive fortune in Geekgold, but literally half his will. Along with a short note explaining that to collect your full inheritance, you must retrieve the second half of Crazy Uncle Scott's will from his old estate, Alden Manor. The very name brings chills to your spine: that place is haunted!

But the true horror lay in the closing passage of the note:

The game is as quick or long as the player makes it. For instance, the murderer will display odd characteristics from the others each time the player takes a turn.

But given the state of the code (Inform 6 of course), I felt compelled to complete what's here and make it a self-contained piece of the larger story. It's not big and it's not serious. It's just a couple of fairly obvious puzzles and one probably somewhat complex puzzle.","NULL","NULL","NULL","Science Fiction","NULL","NULL","NULL","NULL","2016-09-12 08:12:13","g8zi0abmrklhi7ua","2016-09-12 22:54:35","6"
